🔹 1. Concurrency vs Parallelism
| Concept | Meaning | Example |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Concurrency | Handling multiple tasks at once by interleaving their execution. | Making tea and toast — you start the water boiling, then toast bread while waiting. |
| Parallelism | Executing multiple tasks literally at the same time (on different CPU cores). | Two people — one makes tea, one makes toast simultaneously. |

👉 Key:

Concurrency = task switching

Parallelism = true simultaneous execution

🔹 2. Python’s Three Models of “Doing Many Things”
| Type | Best For | Runs On | GIL Impact | Library | Example
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------|-----------|---------
| 🧵 Multithreading | Concurrency I/O-bound tasks | Multiple threads in one process | Yes (GIL blocks CPU-bound work) | threading | Threads are like having multiple people share one desk — only one can write at a time (GIL), but they can take turns fast.
| 🧠 Multiprocessing | Parallelism CPU-bound tasks | Multiple processes, multiple cores | ❌ No GIL issue | multiprocessing | Processes are like giving each person their own desk — they can truly work in parallel, but it’s heavier (each has its own memory).
| ⚡ Asyncio | Concurrency I/O-bound tasks | Single thread, single process | GIL irrelevant | asyncio | Asyncio is like one person multitasking smartly — while waiting for something (like tea boiling), they do something else.

🔹 3. Analogy Summary
| Scenario | Who’s Doing What | Concept
|----------------|---------------------|----------------
| One person making tea, then toast | Sequential | Synchronous
| One person alternating between tea & toast | Concurrency | asyncio or threads
| Two people — one on tea, one on toast | Parallelism | Multiprocessing

🔹 4. When to Use What
| Situation | Recommended Approach
|----------------|---------------------
| Many API calls / I/O waits | Asyncio or Threads
| Heavy computation (image processing, ML) | Multiprocessing
| Small I/O + light CPU mix | Asyncio + ThreadPoolExecutor combo

🔹 5. TL;DR
✅ Threading → Concurrency (I/O)
✅ Multiprocessing → Parallelism (CPU)
✅ Asyncio → Lightweight Concurrency (single-threaded, async)
